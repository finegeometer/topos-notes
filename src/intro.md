# Intro

Lately, I have been interested in a lot of topics surrounding the internal language of Grothendieck toposes.
This is my collection of notes on the topic. Both for [recording what I know about toposes](./reference.md), and for more exploratory work.

- This is not intended to be a finished product. Expect TODOs and unfinished sections.
- I was somewhat inspired by <https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes>, though I haven't read that link closely. I was also inspired by wikis, like the [nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage).

## Technical Details

- Created with [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), and [mdbook-katex](https://github.com/lzanini/mdbook-katex).
- $\LaTeX \to \mathrm{HTML}$ conversion is done at compile time, so Javascript should hopefully be optional for viewing.
