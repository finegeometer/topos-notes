# Noncommutative Synthetic Differential Geometry

Synthetic differential geometry is the study of toposes related to the classifying topos of commutative rings.
Specifically, it studies toposes which support a ring $R$ satisfying some variation of the following axiom:
$$(\hom_{R-alg}(A, R) \to R) \cong A$$

In this exploration, I study toposes related to the classifying topos of star-rings. Not *commutative* star-rings, just star-rings.
This turns out to be a good setting for quantum mechanics.
